## Understanding PlayStation Store Credit and How It Works

### What is PlayStation Store Credit?

PlayStation Store credit refers to the digital currency used on the PlayStation Network (PSN). It allows users to make purchases on the PlayStation Store for a wide range of products, such as games, downloadable content (DLC), subscriptions like PlayStation Plus, themes, and much more. You can earn PlayStation Store credit through various means, from purchasing PSN cards to earning rewards or using specific third-party services.

### How Does PlayStation Store Credit Work?

When you receive PlayStation Store credit, it is automatically added to your PSN account wallet. This balance can be used for digital purchases, game downloads, in-game items, and subscriptions. You can access your credit anytime, making it an extremely convenient form of payment. Once you use your credits for a purchase, the amount is deducted from your wallet until it's exhausted. At that point, you'll need to add more credit to continue making purchases.
